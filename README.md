> ...Set your icons free â€” no manual .ico conversion,no waiting, no crying.

![Built with Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-Rust-orange?logo=rust)  
![Windows Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-10+-0078D6?logo=windows)

A little Rust tool that hooks into your Windows context menu and lets you do what Microsoft *shouldâ€™ve* done:  
Right-click a PNG/JPG â†’ Send To... â†’ "Set Image as Icon" â†’ pick a shortcut â†’ Boom. Instant custom icon.
(Yes..There is even WebP support. Imagine.)

### ðŸ¤¨ Why?

- Mainly, **because Windows wonâ€™t.**  
- Also, Convenience.  
- You *can* convert PNG to .ico manually.

**Or you can just... click.**

### ðŸ‘¥ Contributors Welcome
Found a bug? Want a feature? Open an issue or PR!  
Fork, fork, fork! Hell, turn it into a spaceship for all I care,just say I inspired you somehow.

---

### ðŸ˜­ Current Bugs I'm aware of:
- Currently,Right clicking on anything other than an image,and Using ICObGONE's option...May fail the detection of non image files,And...Results in ICObGONE trying to treat the target as a image,which may or may not cause the heat death of the universe.
